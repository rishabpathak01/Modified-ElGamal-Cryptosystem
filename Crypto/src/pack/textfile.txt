ElGamal encryption and decryption algorithm is based on the difficulty of discrete logarithm problem where it is straight forward to raise numbers to large powers but it is much harder to do the inverse computation of the discrete logarithm There are many algorithms available for solving the discrete logarithm problem of small size numbers in a reasonable time At present the ElGamal encryption algorithm works by sending data to the receiver who has just one private key to decrypt the data which can be guessed by any intruder and is thus not reliable With the need to protect the integrity and privacy of information we proposed a modified ElGamal encryption and decryption algorithm to enhance the security for encrypting long messages and also secure against mathematical and brute force attack as well Low Modulus and KnownPlaintext attack on ElGamal cryptosystem This project provides and an interactive environment to encrypt decrypt or transfer encrypted files without compromising with the integrity and privacy of critical information With the need to protect the integrity and privacy of information belonging to individuals and organizations we have developed this algorithm
